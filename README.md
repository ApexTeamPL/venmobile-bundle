## ⬇️ Download

This repository releases JavaScript bundles for loaders to execute. These are the official Vencore loaders:

### Android

You can install Vencore in 3 ways:

- **🐧 Root with Xposed**: [VencoreXposed](https://github.com/ApexTeamPL/venmobile-xposed/releases/latest)
- **📱 Non-root**: [Vencore Manager](https://github.com/ApexTeamPL/venmobile-manager/releases/latest)

### 🍎 iOS

- 
**NOTE: We do NOT support Vencore IOS as our own app. Once we get enough testers, I will fork the BTLoader and edit it to load Vencore by default. But for now - use BTLoader and follow the instructions written above for other clients.**
